              A former world traveler and teacher, now full stack web developer.
              I have an eye for making aesthetic designs for web applications
              and I really enjoy the satisfaction that comes with building an
              application from scratch. Previously, I was a full time elementary
              teacher and student; teaching during the day and completing my
              teaching certification courses by night. The demands as a teacher
              change at a momentâ€™s notice and these daily challenges gave me
              countless opportunities to problem solve and find innovative
              solutions. In the next phase of my professional career, I want to
              continue learning and improving my back-end development skills and
              work with a team that prioritizes effective communication and
              collaboration.
