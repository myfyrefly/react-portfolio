              I am a full-stack web developer with a newfound love for
              programming! I have an eye for making aesthetic designs for web
              applications and I really enjoy the satisfaction that comes with
              building an application from scratch. Previously, I was a full
              time elementary teacher and student; teaching during the day and
              completing my teaching certification courses by night. The demands
              as a teacher change at a momentâ€™s notice and these daily
              challenges gave me countless opportunities to problem solve and
              find innovative solutions. In the next phase of my professional
              career, I want to continue learning and improving my back-end
              development skills and work with a team that prioritizes effective
              communication and collaboration.
